The question is asking about changes in The Simpsons, so it's probably about the evolution of the show.

            "Wait, the question is specifically about The Simpsons, not the franchise.

            "Okay, so I need to figure out how the animation style of The Simpsons has changed over time. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the specifics, but I know The Simpsons is a long-running show, so its animation style must have evolved. Let me break this down.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I should consider the early seasons. I remember that The Simpsons started in the late '80s, right? I think their animation was pretty basic for the time. It might have used traditional cell animation, which was common back then. The characters probably moved a bit stiffly, and the jokes might have relied more on voice acting and writing rather than visual gags. Maybe the art style wasn't as detailed or vibrant as it became later.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, in the '90s, The Simpsons became more popular. I recall that the animation started to use more vibrant colors and detailed characters. There was also a shift towards using computer animation techniques, so the characters might have moved smoother and the jokes could have been funnier because of the improved visuals. The character development probably got better, and the humor became more varied.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moving into the 2000s, I think the show started using digital animation. This probably made the animation even smoother and allowed for more complex scenes. The characters might have had more expressive faces and better facial expressions. The humor likely became more irreverent and edgier, which sometimes caused some controversy. The art style probably became more stylized, almost like a comic come to life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nowadays, in the 2010s and beyond, The Simpsons has continued to innovate. I've heard that they use 3D animation now. This gives the characters even more life-like features and allows for more intricate jokes and visual gags. The humor might have become more self-aware, poking fun at the fact that it's been around so long. The art style is probably more polished and detailed, with better lighting and effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about all these points. Did they really start with traditional animation? I think so, but I'm not 100% certain. Also, were the '90s really a big shift towards computer animation? I believe so, but maybe there were other changes in between. Also, the '90s had a lot of changes, not just the animation style but also the show's tone. I think the humor became more slapstick and the characters more established.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also consider the impact of other factors, like technological advancements in animation, which influenced The Simpsons' style. For example, the rise of CGI and how the show adopted new tools and software over time. This probably made the animation quality improve and allowed for more creative storytelling.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another aspect is the role of the production team. As the show went on, different directors and animation studios might have brought their own styles, leading to evolution. For example, some seasons might have been produced by different teams, leading to variations in the animation style.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm also curious about how the character design evolved. Did the characters become more stylized or more realistic? I think they started more cartoony and became more detailed and expressive over time, especially with the switch to 3D.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, putting this together, the animation style of The Simpsons has likely gone through several stages: traditional 2D animation in the early years, a shift to computer animation in the '90s with more vibrant colors and detailed characters, a move to digital animation in the 2000s with more expressive faces and edgier humor, and now using 3D animation in the 2010s with lifelike characters and polished visuals.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also mention the impact of these changes on the humor and character development. The animation style probably enhanced the humor by allowing for better visual gags and character expressions, and the characters themselves have become more complex and layered as the animation quality improved.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the evolution of The Simpsons' animation style has been influenced by technological advancements, shifts in production teams, and the natural progression of the show's storytelling needs, leading to a transformation from traditional to modern, detailed, and innovative animation techniques.\n",
            "</think>\n",
            "\n",
            "The evolution of The Simpsons' animation style can be broken down into several key stages, each influenced by technological advancements, changes in production teams, and the evolving needs of the show. Here's a structured overview:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Early 1990s: Traditional Animation with Vibrant Colors**\n",
            "   - The show began with traditional 2D animation, using basic techniques common at the time. The characters were stylized and the humor relied heavily on voice acting and clever writing.\n",

            "2. **Mid-1990s: Shift to Computer Animation**\n",
            "   - The animation transitioned to computer-generated techniques, resulting in smoother character movements and more vibrant, detailed colors. This era introduced more expressive characters and varied humor.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **2000s: Digital Animation with Edgier Humor**\n",
            "   - The shift to digital animation allowed for more complex scenes and expressive facial expressions. The humor became edgier, often pushing boundaries, which sometimes caused controversy.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **2010s and Beyond: 3D Animation with Polished Visuals**\n",
            "   - The show embraced 3D animation, giving characters lifelike features and intricate details. The humor became self-aware, poking fun at the show's long runtime, and the art style was more polished and detailed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Each stage of The Simpsons' animation evolution reflects technological progress and the creative contributions of various production teams, enhancing both the visual quality and storytelling capabilities of the show.\n",
            "<think>\n",
            "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the characters in The Simpsons have evolved over time. I know that The Simpsons is a long-running show, so it's likely that the characters have changed a lot. Let me think about what I know.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I remember that the show started in the late '80s, and the characters were pretty much set in their ways from the beginning. Homer is the lazy, beer-drinking dad, Marge is the responsible mom, Bart is the mischievous son, Lisa is the intellectual daughter, and Maggie is the baby who doesn't talk much. That's the classic setup.\n",
            "\n",
            "But as the show went on, I think the characters started to change. Maybe they had to keep up with the times. I remember that in the '90s, there was a lot of change in society, so the show probably reflected that. For example, Marge might have had more career-oriented storylines. I think she worked at the plant initially but later got promoted or did something else. That shows she's more independent now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Homer also changed. Initially, he was just a stay-at-home dad, but I think he started working at the power plant, which gave him a more active role in the family. Maybe he became more responsible. Also, I recall him dealing with issues like alcoholism, which shows character development.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bart went through high school and college, right? So he moved from being a troublemaker in high school to going to college. That's a big change. He probably had different kinds of storylines, maybe more about college life and growing up.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lisa, being the smart one, probably had more complex storylines. Maybe she got involved in more school projects or had bigger challenges, like environmental issues or social causes. She might have become more politically aware.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maggie was always the silent type, but maybe she started talking more or interacting more with others as the show went on. Or perhaps she had her own little adventures or developed her own personality more.\n",
            "\n",
            "The show also evolved in terms of humor. Initially, it was more slapstick and family-oriented, but as it went on, it incorporated more political jokes, parodies, and satirical elements. That would make the humor sharper and more relevant to current events.\n",
            "\n",
            "The animation style also changed. The early episodes had simpler animations, but as technology improved, the characters and scenes became more detailed and animated. This might have helped in telling more complex stories and adding depth to the characters.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also think the show tackled more serious topics as it went on. It wasn't just about the family's funny adventures anymore; it delved into deeper issues like environmentalism, social issues, and even the challenges of adulthood. This probably made the show more impactful and relevant.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, putting it all together, the characters evolved by becoming more multi-dimensional, dealing with real-life issues, their humor became more sophisticated, the animation improved, and the show's themes became more complex and socially relevant.\n",

            "\n",
            "Then, as the show grew in popularity, I guess they added more characters. There's Bart, Homer, Marge, and Lisa. So the family expanded, which probably changed the structure. Maybe the way each episode was structured became more complex. Maybe the format became more dynamic, involving more characters interacting.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also recall that the show started to have more complex storylines. In the beginning, it might have been episodic, but later on, they did a lot of specials and movies.

            "\n",
            "Another thing is the humor. The initial humor was more slapstick and parodies, but over time, it became more satirical and tackled real-life issues. So the type of jokes and the tone might have evolved, which affects the structure of the show's format.\n",
            "\n",
            "The animation style also changed. The early episodes looked simpler, and later on, they used more detailed character designs and better animation techniques. This must have changed how the show was produced and presented each episode.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, the role of The Simpsons in society is interesting. It became a cultural phenomenon, so maybe the format started to include more societal commentary and current events, which shifted the structure to accommodate that.\n",

Themes might have included corporate greed, media influence, and global issues. The family's dynamics changed too, maybe showing more of Homer's issues at work and the kids dealing with their own problems. The messages probably became more about the consequences of bad leadership and the search for the American Dream.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, in the 2010s, the show continued to evolve. The humor became more absurd and self-aware, even making fun of itself. The characters took on new roles, like Lisa becoming a teenager with her own challenges, and Homer dealing with middle age. Themes might include social media's impact, political parody, and the struggle to maintain identity. Messages might focus on staying true to oneself and the pressures of modern life.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm not sure if I'm missing anything. Maybe the initial questions need more details on specific examples of how the themes changed each decade.

Additionally, the role of the show in society might have evolved too, from a show for kids to something that appeals to a broader audience, addressing more adult themes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, did the show also touch on more current events or political satire as it went on? Like, in recent seasons, they might comment on the political climate of the time.

            "1. **Early Seasons (1989–1993):**\n",
            "   - **Family-Centric Comedy:** The humor was lighthearted and focused on the everyday life of the Simpson family, with a mix of situational comedy and mild slapstick. The tone was family-friendly, with a blend of wit and relatable humor.\n",
            "   - **Character Introduction:** Introducing characters like Mr. Burns and Principal Skinner added depth and began to hint at a slightly darker tone, but it was still primarily comedic.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Middle Years (1994–2000):**\n",
            "   - **Satirical Edge:** The humor became more satirical, tackling social issues and pop culture with irreverence. The tone was sharper and more cutting, yet still clever and funny.\n",
            "   - **Complex Character Interactions:** The family dynamics became more complex, and the humor started reflecting the real-life struggles and relationships of the characters in a more nuanced way.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Late Seasons (2000–2016):**\n",
            "   - **Absurd and Sophisticated Humor:** The humor became more absurd and reliant on clever writing, with the show pushing boundaries and incorporating more visual gags and meta-humor.\n",
            "   - **Cultural Reflection:** The tone often mirrored real-life issues, using satire to comment on societal problems, and the humor became more socially conscious.\n",
            "   - **Character-Driven Comedy:** The humor evolved to focus more on the individual quirks and internal lives of the characters, moving beyond just gags to explore their emotional depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Legacy and Influence:**\n",

            "   - **Evolution of Animation:** The animation style became more detailed and sophisticated, enhancing the visual humor and storytelling.\n",

Despite a 30% pay cut in 2016, they still earned just over $300,000 per episode.\\n\\nIn 2020, following the Black Lives Matter protests, Fox announced that recurring characters of color, like Carl Carlson and Dr. Hibbert, would no longer be voiced by white actors. These roles are now performed by black actors, marking a significant change in voice casting.\\n\\nThe show's supporting cast has also expanded, with characters gaining more prominent roles and even their own episodes.

For example, characters like Carl Carlson and Dr. Hibbert are now voiced by black actors, reflecting a push towards diversity, while Bumblebee Man is voiced by Eric Lopez.

Critics noted a decline in quality, with a shift towards zany antics and celebrity cameos, sacrificing memorable story arcs for short-term gains. Despite this, the show maintained creative highs, especially in animation and storytelling, even as its ratings declined. By the early 2000s, long-time fans began to feel disillusioned, though the series continued to evolve, blending humor with societal commentary. The series also employs a loose continuity, with characters rarely aging and historical backstories remaining inconsistent. While the show has faced criticism for its perceived decline, it has remained a cultural icon, with its golden era often cited as the first ten seasons.\\n\\n```\\n\\nOkay, so I need to figure out how The Simpsons has changed over time based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully. \\n\\nThe context mentions that The Simpsons started with praised humor, wit, and intelligence in its early episodes. But around season 9, the tone changed, and some critics called the show \"tired.\" By 2000, long-term fans were disillusioned, moving away from character-driven plots to more zany antics. Jim Schembri noted the shift towards celebrity cameos and pop culture references, which made the show more about being attention-seeking rather than emotionally grounded.\\n\\nThen, the BBC in 2010 said the golden era ended after season nine. Todd Leopold from CNN also mentioned that for many fans, the glory days are past. However, there\\'s some conflicting opinion. Jon Heacock called the first ten seasons the golden age, and others like Ian Nathan from Empire also considered the classic era as the first ten. So, there\\'s a consensus that after season nine, the quality declined for many.\\n\\nLooking at continuity and the floating timeline, the show uses a loose and inconsistent timeline. Characters don\\'t age, and episodes take place in the year produced. Flashbacks and flashforwards can show them at different points in their lives, but these don\\'t always align with the current timeline. Krusty the Clown\\'s backstory is a good example, as his ability to read varies, but his Jewish background and career history remain consistent.\\n\\nRegarding the cast and crew, Harry Shearer criticized the last three seasons as among the worst, while Dan Castellaneta and Douglas Coupland had differing opinions. Groening said in 2006 that the show was creatively better than ever, but ratings have declined, with the first season averaging 13.4 million viewers versus 7.2 million in the twenty-first season.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, The Simpsons started strong with character-driven humor, moved towards more zany, pop culture-heavy episodes, faced criticism for declining quality after season nine, and saw a decline in ratings. Despite some positive creative aspects, overall perception is that the show\\'s golden era ended after season nine.\\n```\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nOver time, *The Simpsons* evolved from its character-driven, grounded humor in its early seasons to become more focused on pop culture references and celebrity cameos.

Initially praised for its sharp wit, character-driven storytelling, and satirical take on life, the show quickly became a cultural phenomenon. Early seasons (1-9) are often regarded as the golden era, marked by clever writing, memorable characters, and innovative humor. However, by the late 1990s, the show began to shift, moving away from character-driven plots towards more zany and sometimes over-the-top antics, which some fans found disappointing. \\n\\nDespite this change, the series has maintained its popularity, with seasons 1-10 often cited as the show\\'s classic period. The show\\'s success has also allowed it to push creative boundaries, particularly in animation and storytelling, though some critics argue that later seasons have become more focused on shock value and celebrity cameos rather than deeper narratives. \\n\\nThe Simpson family has also aged in a loose, fictional timeline, with characters rarely aging and the show often resetting their lives for comedic effect. Despite this, the show has managed to maintain its cultural relevance, even as ratings have dipped in recent years.\\n\\n## How has the production quality of The Simpsons improved?\\nThe Simpsons has undergone significant changes since its debut in 1989. Initially praised for its sharp wit, character-driven narratives, and realistic humor, the show\\'s tone and structure evolved over time. In its early seasons, it was celebrated for its clever writing, character depth, and cultural relevance. However, by the late 1990s, especially around season nine, the show began to shift towards more zany, sometimes over-the-top humor and a focus on celebrity cameos and pop culture references, which some critics found lacking in depth.\\n\\nThe series also employs a \"floating timeline,\" meaning that while the show often depicts yearly milestones, the characters never age, and events are usually set in the year the episode was produced. This creates a loose continuity, with characters occasionally appearing in inconsistent contexts across different episodes.\\n\\nOver the years, The Simpsons has faced criticism for its perceived decline in quality, with some fans and critics pointing to a loss of the show\\'s original charm and a move towards more absurd and less grounded storytelling. Despite this, the show remains a cultural icon, with its first ten seasons often regarded as its \"golden age.\" However, recent episodes have struggled to maintain the same level of popularity, with ratings declining and the show often only gaining attention through nostalgia or major character returns.\\n\\nIn summary, The Simpsons has evolved from a groundbreaking series known for its intelligence and character-driven stories to a show that, while still influential, has faced criticism for its shift towards more absurd and less focused humor.\\n\\nThe Simpsons has evolved significantly over its decades-long run, transitioning from a groundbreaking series known for its smart humor and character depth to a show that has faced criticism for its declining quality and shifting focus. Initially praised for its wit and realism, the series began to change around season nine, moving away from character-driven narratives toward more zany antics and pop culture references. This shift led to mixed reactions from fans and critics, with some pointing to the loss of the show\\'s original charm.\\n\\nThe show\\'s continuity has also become inconsistent, employing a \"floating timeline\" where characters rarely age and flashbacks often contradict previous storylines. This has led to some confusion among viewers, as characters like Krusty the Clown maintain consistent traits despite contradictory portrayals.\\n\\nWhile the series has remained popular, its ratings have declined, with later seasons averaging fewer viewers compared to its peak. The show\\'s relevance has also diminished, with some arguing that it only retains cultural significance through nostalgia for its golden era, which is often considered to be its first ten seasons.\\n\\nIn summary, The Simpsons has transformed from a innovative and influential series to one that has faced criticism for its declining quality and shifting focus, though it continues to evolve, albeit with mixed reception.\\n\\n```\\n\\nOkay, so I need to figure out how The Simpsons has changed over time. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. It\\'s a long-running animated series that started in the late \\'80s and is still going strong. I remember hearing that the show\\'s quality has been debated among fans. Some think it\\'s declined, while others believe it\\'s still great.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided, it mentions that early episodes were praised for their humor, wit, and intelligence. But by the late \\'90s, around season 9, the tone started to change. Critics called the show \"tired\" and noticed a shift from character-driven plots to more zany antics. Jim Schembri, from The Sydney Morning Herald, said the show became attention-seeking instead of focused on real emotions. That makes sense; I\\'ve heard some long-term fans feel disillusioned by this change.\\n\\nThe BBC noted that the golden era ended after season nine, and Todd Leopold from CNN agreed, saying the glory days are past. However, Jon Heacock from LucidWorks said the first ten seasons were consistently good, with many memorable moments. So, it seems like seasons 1-9 are considered the peak by many.\\n\\nContinuity-wise, the show uses a floating timeline where characters don\\'t age, and events are often reset. For example, in \"The Way We Was,\" they go back to the \\'70s, but Bart is always 10. This loose continuity can be confusing but also allows for creative storytelling.\\n\\nThe cast members have mixed opinions. Harry Shearer criticized the last three seasons, while Dan Castellaneta thinks the show is still creative. Groening, one of the creators, also thinks the show is as good or better now, with detailed animation and new story ideas.\\n\\nIn terms of ratings, the first season had high viewers, but by the twenty-first season, it\\'s down to 7.2 million. This decline suggests that while the show is still popular, it\\'s not as mainstream as before.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, The Simpsons started strong with clever humor and character depth. It shifted towards more chaotic and celebrity-driven episodes, which some fans found lacking. The show\\'s creators say it\\'s still creative, but the overall quality and ratings have declined compared to its peak.\\n\\nI think the key changes are in the tone and focus. Early on, it was character-driven with smart humor. Later, it became more about shock value and zany antics. The cast and crew have tried to keep it fresh, but the shift in tone and declining ratings show that the show\\'s formula has evolved, sometimes to mixed reviews.\\n```\\n\\nThe Simpsons has evolved over its long run, starting with a focus on character-driven humor and witty storytelling in its early seasons. By the late \\'90s, the show began to shift towards more zany antics and celebrity cameos, which some critics found less engaging. While the series has maintained creative efforts, with detailed animation and unique storylines, its overall quality and ratings have declined compared to its peak, with many fans considering the first ten seasons its golden era. The show\\'s loose continuity and floating timeline allow for creative flexibility but can also lead to inconsistencies in character development. Despite these changes, The Simpsons continues to be a culturally significant series, though its impact is now largely through its earlier episodes and iconic characters.\\n```\\n\\nThe Simpsons has evolved over its three decades, transitioning from a smart, character-driven comedy to a blend of clever humor and absurdity. Initially known for its sharp wit and layered humor, the show began with a grounded approach, tackling real-life issues in a funny manner. Early seasons featured well-developed characters like Homer, who was a relatable, slightly clueless father. The humor was layered, appealing to both adults and children.\\n\\nAs the show grew more popular, it began incorporating more pop culture references and celebrity cameos, which added to its appeal but sometimes felt forced. The humor became increasingly chaotic and exaggerated, with characters like Homer getting involved in bizarre situations. The writing expanded, leading to both hit and miss episodes, but the show maintained its humor.\\n\\nIn the late \\'90s and early 2000s, the show faced criticism for losing its edge, with some fans noting a decline in quality. The humor became more juvenile, and the show relied on zany antics without the depth of earlier seasons.\\n\\nHowever, by the mid-2000s, the show found a new rhythm, introducing fresh characters and storylines while maintaining its essence. The humor became a mix of clever writing and absurdity, keeping the show fresh. The animation and production quality improved, making the show look more polished.\\n\\nIn the 2010s, the show continued to evolve, using meta-jokes and self-referential humor, which was funny but sometimes felt like the show was poking fun at itself. Despite some inconsistencies in character development, the show remained popular, especially with long-time fans.\\n\\nToday, The Simpsons is a cultural icon, influencing pop culture and remaining a go-to for quotes and references. While it has faced criticism for declining quality, the show has managed to stay relevant, though it may not be as groundbreaking as it once was.\\n\\nThe Simpsons has evolved from its early days as a pioneer in sitcom humor and character-driven storytelling to a show that now leans more on pop culture references and zany antics. While it has maintained its high-quality animation, it has faced criticism for a perceived decline in quality, with some fans noting a shift from grounded storytelling to more chaotic, shock value-driven humor. The show\\'s continuity remains loose, with characters existing in a floating timeline that often references current or future events, allowing for creative flexibility but also creating inconsistencies. Despite these changes, The Simpsons remains a cultural icon, though its reception among long-time fans has been mixed, as it navigates the challenges of staying relevant in a changing media landscape.\\n\\n## How has The Simpsons influenced pop culture?\\nThe Simpsons has undergone notable evolution over its 34-season run, transitioning from its foundational character-driven humor to a more chaotic and celebrity-driven format. Early episodes were praised for their wit, realism, and character depth, establishing the show\\'s cultural icon status. However, by the late 1990s, the show began to shift, with a focus on zany antics and celebrity cameos, which some critics found lacking in direction. Despite this, the series maintained its popularity, thanks to its innovative storytelling and detailed animation. However, by the 2000s, long-time fans began to feel the show had declined in quality, with a move away from character-driven plots. While the show continued to be a cultural phenomenon, its golden era was often considered to be the first ten seasons. In recent years, the series has faced declining ratings and has been criticized for relying on nostalgia rather than fresh, original stories.

As the show aged, it gradually incorporated more absurd and zany elements to keep pace with contemporary humor and cultural references. The shift from character-driven to situational humor was a deliberate strategy to maintain relevance and comedic appeal. The animation style has also advanced, with technological improvements leading to more detailed and visually intricate episodes. Additionally, the series has expanded its narrative boundaries, exploring flashbacks, flash-forwards, and alternate realities to add depth and complexity to its storytelling. Despite these changes, The Simpsons remains a cherished part of popular culture, continuing to resonate with new generations of fans.\\n\\n'"
